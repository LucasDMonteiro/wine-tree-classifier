# Classification of wine samples using Decision Trees
This Jupyter Notebook was developed as an assignment for a class I took in my Master's program.

This Jupyter Notebook trains a Decision Tree model on tabular data from the chemycal analysis of wine samples, in order to classify the sample's origin.
Source dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/isolet

The script uses Sci-kit Learn to split the dataset into training and evaluation sets, train it using DecisionTreeClassifier, and measure the model's accuracy.
